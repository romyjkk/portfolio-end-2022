                            quickly decided, when my boyfriend suggested I do it about cats. Cats are my favorite
                            animals, and this way I can combine a few things I’m very interested in: JavaScript and
                            cats!</p>

                        <p>My first idea was to make a map in which the origin of each cat breed is shown. I decided to
                            use Leaflet for this, since my teacher recommended it to us. Leaflet is a JavaScript
                            library, for interactive maps. I was able to use a JSON file, which stored all my data. With
                            a forEach loop, markers were made for every single cat. This didn’t look very nice yet,
                            since it just showed a basic location marker. So I added a custom marker and it fit way
                            better in the theme!

                        <p>D3 is another JavaScript library we learned about, with which you can manipulate documents
                            based on data. A big part of the visualisations you’re able to create with D3 are SVG’s
                            (Scalable Vector Graphics). I decided to use this, because I wanted to make some sort of bar
                            chart, which showcased the 10 most popular cats in different countries/continents. A filter
                            function should be included for some extra interaction. I added the data I was able to find
                            in another JSON file and got to work!</p>

                        <p>Using a bunch of examples from my teachers and ofcourse the internet, I made a bar chart.
                            Instead of a normal bar, I wanted to add images so you could really see which cats the chart
                            would be talking about. I asked my teacher about this, and he told me I had to create a
                            different SVG pattern for each cat, with matching height and width attributes. Since there
                            were quite a few different cats, it took me a while. I also quickly realised I had to make
                            the images fit inside of the bars, which means I had to do some adjustments in Photoshop.

                            the right item. By adding an eventListener I made sure that, when you clicked the buttons,
                            the right items showed. This was done by giving the buttons a value.
